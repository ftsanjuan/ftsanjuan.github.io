I'm not the biggest blogger. I find I enjoy coding up a new project more than I do writing up a new post.

So when the opportunity to redo my blog came up, I figured I'd do what like best: make it worthwhile; turn it into a project.

Rather than using a full-fledged CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc) or rolling my own from a framework (Ruby on Rails), I figured I'd try out Github's own `jekyll`.

It's working out pretty nicely.
