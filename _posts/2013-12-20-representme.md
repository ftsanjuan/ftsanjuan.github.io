We're more blessed in North America than we care to think about.

For all the `#firstworldproblems` we trifle and tweet about, there are innumerable real-world issues which remain unspoken.

Every Christmas, we get the chance to show that we're not just thinking about ourselves; we show that we're looking out for others: coworkers, friends, family, etc. This year we have a unique opportunity to look even further beyond our circles, to think globally, and consider those in a season of desperate need.

I built [repr.esent.me](http://repr.esent.me) because this Christmas, I could forgo some treats and niceties if others in need could receive a little more care and concern.

Maybe if I can get even one friend to look out just a little bit wider, then they could convince one of their friends to do the same.

Merry Christmas!
